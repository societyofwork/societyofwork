    testimonial: Society of Work is THE place to work and connect. I'm so grateful
      to have this place as source of focus + networking. There is no value I could
      place on how great this place has been for my work life/flow. And I love the
      feel of the coworking spaces, the vibe the building, and the amenities it provides!

    testimonial: Most importantly great tenants and hosts. The best place to plug
      into the startup community with great facilities and a constant flow of events
      that are enjoyable and topical.

    testimonial: We love working at Society of Work.  After having worked from home
      for some time, this space has been such a wonderful alternative to allow for
      more focused work and great interaction with others.  The community of people
      and the comfortable space is just right for our team. We couldn't be happier!
